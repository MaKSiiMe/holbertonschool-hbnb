### ðŸ“˜ [Part 1: UML Diagrams](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-HBnB/tree/main/HBnB-UML)  
We started the development of the HBnB Evolution application by creating a detailed blueprint. This technical documentation compiles essential diagrams and explanations, serving as a comprehensive guide to the systemâ€™s architecture, design, and implementation steps, from user interactions to database operations.  

#### Key Points:  
1. [High-level architecture](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-HBnB/blob/main/HBnB-UML/0-%20High-Level_Package_Diagram.md) with a package diagram outlining the three layers and the use of the **Facade Pattern**.

2. [Detailed diagrams of the business logic layer](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-HBnB/blob/main/HBnB-UML/1-%20Detailed_Class_Diagram_for_Business_Logic_Layer.md) illustrating key entities, their relationships, and their role in the system.

3. [Sequence diagrams for key API interactions](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-HBnB/blob/main/HBnB-UML/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_API_calls.md) depicting critical operations such as:  
    - [User registration](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-HBnB/blob/main/HBnB-UML/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_user_registration.md)  
    - [Place creation](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-HBnB/blob/main/HBnB-UML/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_place_creation.md)  
    - [Review submission](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-HBnB/blob/main/HBnB-UML/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_review_submission.md)  
    - [Fetching places](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-HBnB/blob/main/HBnB-UML/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_fetching_a_list_of_places.md)
